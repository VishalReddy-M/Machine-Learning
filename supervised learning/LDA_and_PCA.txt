LDA --> linear discriminant analysis
lda is a supervised learning dimensionality reduction technique that reduces
dimensions while it maximising class separability
it mainly focuses on the features helpful to the target variable
objective:
it mainly tries to
1.minimize distance within class
2.maximize distance between different classes
the work is to make combination of nearest features
just it focuses on x values


PCA--> principle component analysis
it is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique
it transforms original features into new set of orthogonal features
called principal components
it starts from where the variance is high
1.transforms original features
pca creates new features from old features
2.principal components
3.maximum variance
variance = information
the PCA keeps the direction where the data spreads the most
it creates new pCs based on the input features inorder wise
PC1,PC2....
the average of PCs will be the new feature
