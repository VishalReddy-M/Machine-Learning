We have to use similarity and distances to find the relationship between two datapoints
Algorithms:
1.KNN
2.K-Means clustering
3.hierarcial clustering
4.DIVISE(UNSUP)...
5.NLP
6.Image processing

Implementations:
KNN ALGO
1.SIMILARITY DISTANCE BASED MEASURE INTRO
2.COSINE SIMILARITY
JACCARD SIMILARITY
PEARSON CORRELATION
SPEARMAN RANK CORELATION
3 DISTANCE BASED MEASURES

4.KNN  INTRO WITH PARAMETER
5.KNN PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION

1.Cosine similarity
angle between two vectors
formula ==> Cosine(theta) = A.B/||A|.|B||
theta--> 1TO 90 --> RELATED
        90--> UNRELATED
        >90--> OPPOSITE
SYNTAX: from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

2.JACCARD SIMILARITY
the overlap between 2 sets
formula: JACCARD = intersection of 2 sets/union of 2 sets
ex: recommendation system,plagiarism relation
SYNTAX: from sklearn.metrics import jaccard_score

3.PEARSON CORELATION
also known as pattern similarity
the linear relationship between 2 variables
checks 2 variables increases/decreases/constant
RANGE:
+1 = perfect
0 = no 
-1 = negative

4.SPEARMAN RANK CORELATION
rank based method 
handles non linear data
gives preference to order 
SYNTAX: from scipy.stats import spearmanr
