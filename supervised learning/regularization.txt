regularization:
it is like punishing the mdel i.e; penalty the model if weights become too large
Types:
1.ridge regression
2.lasso regression

Ridge regression:
    it is also known as L2-regularization
    it is the error and penalty on square of weights
    lambda--> it decides how strict the punishment will be 
    if the weights are huge it is not going to remove but it is going to minimize the weights

it is used when all the features are important ,when the features are corelated ,when we want stable predictions

lasso regression:
    it is also known as L1-regularization
    it is the error and penalty on absolute weights
    lambda--> it decides how strict the punishment will be 
    it can make some weights exactly 0
    automatically it does the feature selections

it is used when our dataset has too many features
and the features contains useless information in some of them
when we can't decide the importance of features then i automatically decide the feature selections
