#UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
it is a machine learning approach where the dataset has no labels
we only have input(X) but no target(Y)
the algorithm learns the structure ,patterns,relationships which are hidden
inside the data.
we use unsupervised learning when we don't know the label of the output
we organize the raw data 
reduce dimensions
we can extract the hidden structures
TYPES OF UNSUPERVISED LEARNING:
1.CLUSTERING
2.DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION
3.ASSOCIATION RULE MINING

1.CLUSTERING
the machine learns the grouping data points into clusters based on their
their similarities
a.partition based clustering
also called as K-means clustering---> hard clustering
divides into K clusters based on distance measures like euclidean 
we use standard scaler here
b.hierarchical clustering
tree like structure called dendogram to show cluster relations
c.density based clustering
also called as DBSCAN
forms clustering based on high density regions in the data

2.DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION
reducing the number of features while keeping the important information
a.PCA
b.Autoencoder --> mostly used in neural networks

3.ASSOCIATION RULE MINING
used to detect the nearby data points
a.apriori
suggesting another thing based on the previous things which are related to each other
based on preferences
Ex: instamart,blinkit

Metrics:
measure cluster quality,separation,density,similarity
1.silhouette score
measures how similar a point to its own cluster compared to other
range:
+1 ---> perfect
0 ---> overlapping
-1 ---> wrong/bad separation

2.Davies bouldin index(DBI)
used to check the average similarity between the clusters
lower value = better clustering
range:
0 ---> perfect
higher ---> bad

3.Dunn index
used to check the ratio of smallest clustering to largest
higher value = better clustering

4.Caliinski-harabasz index
in cluster how each data point is connected
ratio between the cluster dispersions
ratio within cluster
higher == better cluster

#HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING

it is a clustering technique that builds a tree like structure of clusters
it displays the dendogram tree
TYPES:
1.agglomerative 
2.divisive

#AGGLOMERATIVE
it is also known as bottom-up approach
it start with each data point on its own clusters --> keep merging the closest clusters
--> continue until only one big cluster is left
it is bottom-up ,because we start from the smallest,individual units and build upward
into biggest groups

start: many clusters
end: one cluster
operation: merge

2.DIVISIVE 
it is also known as top-down approach

start: all data points in one cluster
end: until every point is separated (many individual clusters)
operation: splitting
The divisive is less commonly used because of it computational working
and it is not suite for large data when compared to hierarchical clustering
