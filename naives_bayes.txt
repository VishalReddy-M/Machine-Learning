Naive Bayes Algorithm
it is a probabilistic Algorithm
it follows bayes therom
every feature is independent of each other and it throws a connection to target
it is a classification Algorithm
NAIVE means independent
execution is very fast 
works very well for text classification
it handles high dimensional data
simple and easy to implement
TYPES:
1.GAUSSIAN NAIVE BAYES
2.BERNOULLI NAIVE BAYES
3.MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES

1.GAUSSIAN:
--> it is used for continous numerical data / real numbers
it is used when the feaatures are continous values
it follows the normal distribution
EX:
--> medical data(diabetes,bp)
--> weather prediction 
--> iris 
height,weight,marks,salary,price 
all the sensor data
0,1,2,3,4

2.BERNOULLI
it is used for binary or boolean features
(0/1,true/false)
it is used when the features presence and absence
EX:
spam/ham Emails,
medical (disease present are not)
(0,1)

3.MULTINOMIAL
it is used for count ,frequency of words
it is used when features are countable are it is having frequencies
EX:
text classification
spam Emails
sentiment analysis
news article classification
--> text related ,discrete,counts,frequencies
